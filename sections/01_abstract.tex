\par Detecting whether or not a software is malicious is a difficult task.
The context under which software is executing plays an important role in
understanding malicious behavior.
Current malware detection strategies have shown high classification accuracy,
but they lack contextual considerations.
The objective of this thesis is to address the development of a context-aware
malware detection system.
A definition of context and how it pertains to malware detection is discussed.
Based on this definition, two proof-of-concept context-aware models utilizing
Latent Dirichlet Allocation are developed to address different aspects of
context.
These models provide insight into the challenges of including context in
malware detection models, and future work to improve the contextual aspects
of the models is discussed.
