\par There are many people I must thank who have made this journey possible.
First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr.\ Rashmi Jha for helping to
connect me with exciting research opportunities and guiding me along the way.
I am also very appreciative of her research group for helpful discussions over
the research, with a special thank you to Tyler Westland for helping me learn
how to use Linux properly.

\par Thank you to Dr\@. David Kapp and Dr\@. Temesguen Kebede from the Air
Force Research Laboratory for great research discussions, brainstorming, and
helping me iterate through my ideas.

\par Of course, I would like to thank my friends and family for their support
throughout my college career.
Finally, big thanks to my cat, Pixel, for keeping my spirits up and keeping me
company, especially over the past year during Covid.

\par This work was supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory under the
DAGSI-SOCHE Award No. RY8-UC-20-1.
