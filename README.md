# Context-Aware Malware Detection Using Topic Modeling

This repo contains the LaTeX for my MS thesis at UC.
It was funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under the DAGSI-SOCHE
Award No. RY8-UC-20-1.

The report is broken up into sections in [here](./sections/).
Both the report and defense slides share the [./img/](./img/) directory.

If you like my work, please give it a download over at [OhioLINK](
http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=ucin162766765703398) and bump up my
download count. ;)

It is also available as a technical report published by AFRL [here](
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD1146448), although please note there were
some small edits made after this version was put out.
Those changes are in the OhioLINK version.

## Code

for public release.

## Publications
